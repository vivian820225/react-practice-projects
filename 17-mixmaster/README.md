#### SPA - React Router

SPA stands for Single-Page Application, which is a web application that dynamically updates its content without requiring a full page reload. It achieves this by loading the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources and then dynamically fetching data and updating the DOM as users interact with the application.

React Router is a JavaScript library used in React applications to handle routing and navigation. It provides a declarative way to define the routes of an application and render different components based on the current URL. React Router allows developers to create a seamless, client-side navigation experience within a SPA by mapping URLs to specific components and managing the history and URL changes.

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

```sh
npm i react-router-dom@6.11.2
```

App.jsx

```js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom'

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <h2>home page</h2>,
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    element: (
      <div>
        <h2>about page</h2>
      </div>
    ),
  },
])
const App = () => {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />
}
export default App
```

#### React Router - Action

Route actions are the "writes" to route loader "reads". They provide a way for apps to perform data mutations with simple HTML and HTTP semantics while React Router abstracts away the complexity of asynchronous UI and revalidation. This gives you the simple mental model of HTML + HTTP (where the browser handles the asynchrony and revalidation) with the behavior and UX capabilities of modern SPAs.

#### Styled Components

- CSS in JS
- Styled Components
- have logic and styles in component
- no name collisions
- apply javascript logic
- [Styled Components Docs](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Styled Components Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/styled-components-tutorial-and-project-course/?referralCode=9DABB172FCB2625B663F)

```sh
npm install styled-components
```

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'

const El = styled.el`
  // styles go here
`
```

- no name collisions, since unique class
- vscode-styled-components extension
- colors and bugs

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
const StyledBtn = styled.button`
  background: red;
  color: white;
  font-size: 2rem;
  padding: 1rem;
`
```

#### Alternative Setup

- style entire react component

```js
const Wrapper = styled.el``

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <h1> Component</h1>
    </Wrapper>
  )
}
```

- only responsible for styling
